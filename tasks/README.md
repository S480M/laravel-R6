-What is Laravel queue?
The Laravel queue service provides a unified API across a variety of different queue back-ends. Queues allow you to defer the processing of a time consuming task, such as sending an e-mail, until a later time which drastically speeds up web requests to your application.

-How to use Laravel Queues?

Step 1: Configure your Queue Driver
To configure the queue driver, navigate to the .env file in your Laravel application root directory and set the QUEUE_CONNECTION variable to the driver you want to use:
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis

Step 2: Create a Job Class
create a job class that represents the task you want to process. Job classes should extend the Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue interface, which indicates that the job can be added to the queue.

For example, creating a job that sends an email to a user:
php artisan make:job SendEmailJob

Step 3: Dispatch the Job to the Queue
Once you have defined your job class, you can dispatch it to the queue using the dispatch method. For example, let's dispatch the SendEmailJob with the user object as its parameter:
$user = User::find(1);
dispatch(new SendEmailJob($user));

Step 4: Process the Queue
To process the queued jobs, you will need to start a queue worker. Laravel provides several queue workers, including the php artisan queue:work command, which runs a worker that continuously polls the queue and processes jobs as they become available.
php artisan queue:work

Step 5: Monitor the Queue
You can monitor the status of your queued jobs using the Laravel Horizon package, which provides a dashboard that displays information about the queue workers, jobs, and failed jobs.
To install and configure Laravel Horizon, run the following command:
composer require laravel/horizon
